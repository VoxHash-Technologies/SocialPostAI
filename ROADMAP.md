# Roadmap

## Near Term
- Webview preview with facet inspector and character counters
- Persisted schedule queue with restart-safe storage
- Retry/backoff for publish adapters with platform-aware errors
- Multi-account profiles and per-command account targeting

## Mid Term
- VS Code tests for command palette UX
- Workspace context ingestion (diffs, commits) for richer drafting
- Inline validation hints per platform
- Optional image/media attachment pipeline

## Long Term
- Team workflows with approvals
- Observability without telemetry (local-only metrics)
- Additional platforms when privacy-safe
