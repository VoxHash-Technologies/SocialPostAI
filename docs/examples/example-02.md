# Example 02: Scheduled Cross-Post

1. Copy this text:
   ```
   Preparing a deep-dive on our Threads + Bluesky adapters and scheduled dispatch flow. Looking for feedback on auth ergonomics and facet coverage.
   ```
2. Run `SocialPostAI: Publish to All Platforms`
3. Choose tone: `technical`
4. Select “Schedule later”
5. Enter an ISO timestamp in the future (e.g., `2026-01-20T18:00:00Z`)
6. Keep VS Code running; the output channel logs scheduled job ids and execution
